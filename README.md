# Tech Docs Template - Page Expiry Notifier

This repository was [forked](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-monitor) from our friends at [alphagov](https://github.com/alphagov). ü§ù

This repo is part of the [tech-docs-template][template], and is used in conjunction with the [page expiry feature][expiry] that is part of the [tech-docs-gem][gem].

GitHub Actions will run the script once a day during weekdays.
It will look at the pages API for your site, find all pages that have expired, and post a Slack message to the owner of each page to let them know that it needs reviewing.

## How can I use this service? 

Usage is simple, you will need to: 
- update your documentation as per the example below
- submit a PR to enable the notifier.

### Example GitHub Pages Configuration 

In [this](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-operations/blob/main/source/documentation/team-guide/team-tools.html.md.erb) file the following lines define:
- Slack channel the reminder will be sent to
- Title of the reminder
- last reviewed date
- when the document should next be reviewed

```
---
owner_slack: "#mojo-devops"
title: Team Tools
last_reviewed_on: 2021-04-28
review_in: 3 months
---
...
```

‚ö†Ô∏è The `last_reviewed_on` field should be updated via Pull Request when a review is complete.

[gem]: https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem

### Submit a PR

If you are part of the `ministryofjustice` GitHub organisation you can enable the notifier by raising a PR to add your published documentation to the [`Rakefile`][Rakefile]:

```
pages_urls = [
  "https://ministryofjustice.github.io/cloud-operations/api/pages.json",
  "https://ministryofjustice.github.io/<<your-team-name>>/api/pages.json",

]
```

If you want to limit the number of links that are posted to Slack after a single run, add this to  `limits` in the [`Rakefile`][Rakefile]

```
limits = {
  "https://ministryofjustice.github.io/<<your-team-name>>/api/pages.json" => 3
}
```

The default behaviour is no limit, and the Slack message will contain all pages discovered.
