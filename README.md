# Tech Docs Template - page expiry notifier

This repo is part of the [tech-docs-template][template], and is used in
conjunction with the [page expiry feature][expiry] that is part of the
[tech-docs-gem][gem]

Concourse CI will run the script once a day during weekdays.
It will look at the pages API for your site, find all pages that have expired, and post a Slack message to the owner of each page to let them know that it needs reviewing.

[template]: https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template
[expiry]: https://alphagov.github.io/tech-docs-manual/#last-reviewed-on-and-review-in
[gem]: https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem

## Usage

### `alphagov` users

If you are part of the `alphagov` GitHub organisation you can enable the notifier by raising a PR to add your published documentation to the [`Rakefile`][Rakefile]:

```
pages_urls = [
  "https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/api/pages.json",
  "https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/api/pages.json",
  "your-docs-site.cloudapps.digital"
]
```

If you want to limit the number of links that are posted to Slack after a single run, add this to  `limits` in the [`Rakefile`][Rakefile]

```
limits = {
  "your-docs-site.cloudapps.digital" => 3
}
```

The default behaviour is no limit, and the Slack message will contain all pages discovered.

### General configuration

The following environment variables are necessary:

* `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: The Slack webhook URL to allow messages to be posted.
* `REALLY_POST_TO_SLACK`: Messages will only be posted to Slack if the value of
  this var is `1`.

#### Slack message customisation

This is the default Slack message when pages expire:

You can customise parts of the Slack message by configuring environment variables. The environment variables you can customise are:

| Environment variable name     | Purpose                                                         | Default value                                                                          |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OVERRIDE_SLACK_MESSAGE_PREFIX | Sets a custom message prefix.                                   | "Hello :paw_prints:, this is your friendly manual spaniel."                            |
| OVERRIDE_SLACK_CHANNEL        | Sets a single Slack channel to which all messages will be sent. | The owning Slack channel for each page reported in the site's /api/pages.json endpoint |
| OVERRIDE_SLACK_USERNAME       | Sets the username to which Slack messages are attributed.       | "Daniel the Manual Spaniel"                                                            |
| OVERRIDE_SLACK_ICON_EMOJI     | Sets the icon emoji attributed to Slack messages.               | ":daniel-the-manual-spaniel:"                                                          |
